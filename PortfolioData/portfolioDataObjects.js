    projectSummary: 
    "\tVusar is a startup in the tech industry who is developing an app that will enable collaboration among engineers away from their computers and into the real, tangible world. I was brought in as an iOS Developer intern and have been since. This company has given me a learning oppurtunity into the world of iOS Development and it was my first experience in this field.\n\n\tI can't too much about the app as I am still under my NDA agreement however I may share some of what I have contributed to the team. My role on the team has varied, but it focuses a lot on building the features, as well as distribution of the builds to testers. I aided in the research and integration of loading in .usdz files from the user's database and into their Augmented Reality session. I also, contributed to User Interface of the Object Info Card. Lastly, I set up the Provisioning Profiles, as well as updating them with new testers. Along with this responsibility, I integrated fastlane to automate the deployment process.\n\n\tThis oppurtunity has given me a lot of insight into what it is like to be a developer. It not only taught me how to develop iOS Apps, but it also taught me other invaluable skills such as problem solving, how to be resourcefull to find the solution to problems, and communication with my team and through our frequent SCRUM meetings."
