			<p style="margin-top: 5px">
				As a student at UCI, I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a specialization in information. I currently am interning at two startups which both involve iOS Development. Even though I mainly do iOS Developmet however, my curiosity for other fields has lead me to dabble in other things such as web and game developemnt. I not only have an interest in development, but I also intend to look into the world of Cybersecurity as I find that field very interesting.
